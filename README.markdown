# KillrVideo Integration Tests #

This application will run **integration tests** for the **[KillrVideo]** server (whatever the chosen language of implementation)

## Setting Docker env variables

If you're running on Linux with Docker, just execute the file _getenvirongment.sh_ as explained below.

If you're running Docker4Mac (and not Docker Toolbox with VirtualBox), you need to find manually the current host IP and the HyperKit VM IP:

- type `ifconfig | grep inet`. The HyperKit VM IP is on this list as well as your host IP
- don't use `127.0.0.1` as your host IP since it's a loopback address
- type `export KILLRVIDEO_DOCKER_IP=<HyperKit_VM_IP>`
- type `export KILLRVIDEO_HOST_IP=<Host_IP>`

## Running Locally

This application is not MEANT to be run in a stand-alone mode but inside a Docker compose config. However it is still possible to run it as a separated application by following the below steps: 

* First clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/killrvideo/killrvideo-integration-tests.git`
* Ensure that you have already run the Docker images for KillrVideo (with a `docker-compose ...`) 
* Ensure that you have already run your own implementation of KillrVideo server
* Execute the script _getenvirongment.sh_ to set environment variables with `. ./getenvironment.sh`

> **warning: the first dot (.) is important! It will execute the script in the context of the calling shell**
<br/>

* Create the following folder `/tmp/cucumber-report` so that test HTML report can be generated 
* Run the tests suite with `mvn clean test`


## Running as a Docker image

You can integrate the Docker image of this application inside a `docker-compose.yaml` as follow:

```yaml

 it_test_suite:
    image: killrvideo/killrvideo-integration-tests:latest
    ports:
    # Zeppelin WEB UI port
    - 8080:8080
    # Python HTTP Web Server port
    - 8123:8123
    depends_on:
    - etcd
    - cassandra
    environment:
      KILLRVIDEO_DOCKER_IP: $KILLRVIDEO_DOCKER_IP
      SERVICE_8080_NAME: zeppelin
      SERVICE_8123_NAME: python_web_server
```
